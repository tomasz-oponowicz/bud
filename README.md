# Basic Underwater Demolition Training

This is Basic Underwater Demolition Training, where a junior JavaScript developer becomes a senior one. No excuses. No mercy.

## Workout Phases

1. Go to `https://codility.com/programmers/lessons/`.
1. Pick up a next task.
1. Code a solution in the `solution.js` file.
    1. Boost coding by reusing live tests and algorithms in the `toolbox/`.
    1. No idea? Check a 100%/100% solution in the `lessons/`.
1. Go back to the 2. item.

Never surrender! Go, go!
